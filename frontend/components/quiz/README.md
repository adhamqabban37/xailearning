    // Save progress for resuming later
    localStorage.setItem(`quiz_${progress.quizId}`, JSON.stringify(progress))
  }

  const handleQuizComplete = (progress: QuizProgress) => {
    setQuizProgress(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      [progress.quizId]: progress
    }))
    
    // Send to backend
    fetch('/api/quiz-results', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(progress)
    })
  }

  return (
    <Quiz

```typescript
// Save quiz progress
POST /api/quiz-progress
{
  courseId: string,
  moduleId: string,
  progress: QuizProgress
}

// Get quiz results
GET /api/quiz-results/:courseId/:moduleId

// Submit practical exercise
POST /api/exercise-submission
{
  exerciseId: string,
  submission: string,
  attachments?: File[]
}
```

### Data Synchronization

The quiz system is designed to work with your existing backend models:

- `QuizBlock` matches backend `QuizBlock` schema
- `QuizQuestion` aligns with backend `QuizQuestion` model
- Progress tracking integrates with `Progress` table
- Assignment submissions work with existing assignment system

## üß™ Testing

### Sample Data Provided

The system includes comprehensive sample data for testing:

- **React Fundamentals Quiz**: Mixed question types covering React concepts
- **Python Programming Quiz**: Coding-focused questions with practical exercises
- **Full-Stack Project Assessment**: Project-based evaluation with assignments

### Integration Testing

```tsx
import { QuizExamples } from './components/quiz'

// Use the comprehensive example component to test all features
function TestPage() {
  return <QuizExamples />
}
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**: Components are modular for easy tree-shaking
2. **Lazy Loading**: Question types can be loaded on-demand
3. **Memoization**: Expensive validation operations are cached
4. **Local Storage**: Progress is saved locally for resuming

### Security Considerations

1. **Client-side validation is for UX only** - Always validate on backend
2. **Answer keys should not be exposed** - Consider server-side validation
3. **Time limits are enforced client-side** - Backend should verify
4. **File uploads need security scanning** - Implement virus scanning

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Collaborative quizzes for group learning
- [ ] Advanced analytics with learning path recommendations
- [ ] Integration with external code execution environments
- [ ] AI-powered feedback generation
- [ ] Adaptive questioning based on performance
- [ ] Offline mode with synchronization

### Customization Options
- [ ] Custom themes and branding
- [ ] Question type plugins
- [ ] Custom validation rules
- [ ] Internationalization support

## üìù Contributing

When adding new question types:

1. Create component in `components/questions/`
2. Add to `QuestionRenderer.tsx` switch statement
3. Update `quiz.ts` types
4. Add validation logic to `quizValidation.ts`
5. Include sample data and documentation
