export const UNIVERSAL_PROMPT = `You are an expert instructional designer, AI researcher, and content curator. Your job is to analyze any given text, PDF, or document and transform it into a structured, interactive learning experience for the learner.

OBJECTIVE:
Take the provided text (which can come from a prompt, document, or pasted content) and convert it into a complete AI-powered learning roadmap, ready for use as an online course.

The user has specified that the desired length of the course should be short. Please tailor the number of sessions and lessons, and the depth of the content, to fit this duration.

üß† MANDATORY ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

Course Structure Detection

Identify and organize the document into clear sessions, lessons, and steps, even if the text uses different labels (e.g., Day 1, Module 2, Part 3, etc.).

Generate missing or unclear titles automatically for any unnamed sections.

Add short, descriptive subtitles if missing.

Time Estimates

Detect and extract all mentions of time (e.g., ‚Äú15 minutes,‚Äù ‚Äú2 hours‚Äù).

If missing, suggest reasonable default estimates (e.g., 10 minutes per lesson, 5 minutes per quiz).

Calculate and return the total estimated time required to learn all the content.

üìπ Resource Extraction & Video Validation ‚úÖ (Improved)

Extract all external resources such as YouTube videos, articles, PDFs, or references.

If none exist, search and recommend 3‚Äì5 high-quality external resources (YouTube, official docs, blogs) relevant to the lesson topics.

For YouTube videos:

Verify each video is embeddable and publicly accessible (not private, age-restricted, or region-blocked).

Only include YouTube URLs in one of these formats:

youtube.com/watch?v=

youtube.com/embed/

youtu.be/

Exclude Shorts (/shorts/) and Live (/live) videos that could break the embed.

If a video fails validation, automatically replace it with a top embeddable result from YouTube search for the same topic.

Include a debug object for non-embeddable videos explaining the reason.

Always return resources in this format:

{
  "title": "Intro to Neural Networks - YouTube",
  "type": "video",
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk",
  "embeddable": true,
  "verified_source": true
}


If the video is not embeddable, return:

{
  "title": "Advanced Neural Networks - YouTube",
  "type": "video",
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx",
  "embeddable": false,
  "note": "Unavailable for embedding ‚Äî open on YouTube directly",
  "debug_reason": "Private, age-restricted, or region-blocked"
}


Quiz Generation

Create 3‚Äì5 multiple-choice quiz questions per session that check understanding of the material.

Each question MUST have:

One correct answer

3‚Äì4 plausible distractors

All options should be clearly related to the lesson content

A "type" property (e.g., "type": "MCQ")

Use this format:

{
  "question": "What is a neural network?",
  "type": "MCQ",
  "options": ["A computer", "A learning algorithm", "A data storage system", "A type of database"],
  "answer": "A learning algorithm",
  "explanation": "A neural network is a computational model inspired by biological neural networks that learns patterns from data."
}


Checklist Creation

Generate a missing-elements checklist noting anything the user needs to complete or clarify (e.g., missing titles, unclear time estimates, no external resources, non-embeddable videos).

Formatting & Output

Return your entire analysis in clean, organized JSON for easy parsing.

Include debug info for any non-embeddable videos in the checklist or resource object.`;

// Note: The prompt above is designed to produce clean, organized JSON only.
// The frontend parsers assume JSON objects for:
// - course structure (sessions/lessons/steps)
// - time estimates and total
// - resources with YouTube embeddability flags
// - quizzes (MCQs per session with explanations)
// - a missing-elements checklist for any gaps

export const PROMPT_INSTRUCTIONS = `## How to Use This Prompt

1. Copy the entire prompt above and provide or paste your source text/document.
2. Specify that the course should be short (default assumed if unspecified).
3. Paste into your LLM (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini).
4. Ensure the response is clean, organized JSON only (no extra prose) for easy parsing.

What you‚Äôll get:
- Sessions, lessons, steps with auto-generated titles when missing
- Time estimates per item and total duration
- Curated resources with YouTube embeddability validation and debug info
- 3‚Äì5 MCQs per session with explanations
- A checklist of missing elements or issues to address`;
