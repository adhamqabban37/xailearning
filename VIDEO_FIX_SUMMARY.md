# 🛠️ Video URL Issue - FIXED

## What Was Wrong

You were seeing:

```
This video isn't available anymore
Invalid YouTube URL
Try opening in browser
```

**Cause:** The AI was generating video resources **without valid URLs** or with **placeholder URLs**.

## What I Fixed

### ✅ 1. Enhanced AI Prompt

- Now explicitly tells AI: "You MUST provide REAL, VALID YouTube URLs"
- Provides actual real video IDs (from freeCodeCamp, etc.)
- Examples: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw`, `watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg`
- Warns AI not to use placeholder URLs

### ✅ 2. Added URL Validation

- Components now check if URLs exist before rendering
- Filters out resources with missing/invalid URLs
- Prevents crashes and shows warnings in console

### ✅ 3. Better Error Logging

- Server logs show exact URLs being generated
- Browser console shows if URLs are missing
- Easy to diagnose problems

## 🧪 Test It Now

1. **Generate a NEW course** at http://localhost:9002

   - The AI should now provide real YouTube URLs

2. **Open browser console (F12)** and look for:

   ```
   📹 Lesson "Lesson Name" resources: { youtube: 2, articles: 1, total: 3 }
     YouTube URLs: [
       { title: "Video Title", url: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...", hasUrl: true }
     ]
   ```

3. **Check videos in lessons**:
   - ✅ Should show thumbnails
   - ✅ Should have play buttons
   - ✅ Should load when you click

## 🔍 What to Look For

**Good Signs** ✅

- Videos show thumbnails with play buttons
- Console shows `hasUrl: true` for all videos
- URLs start with `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=`
- No "Invalid YouTube URL" errors

**Bad Signs** ❌

- Still seeing "Invalid YouTube URL"
- Console shows `hasUrl: false`
- Warnings: `⚠️ Resource missing URL`
- Videos don't appear in lessons

## 📝 If Still Having Issues

If you **still** see invalid URLs after generating a new course:

1. **Check the console logs** - Share them with me
2. **Try a different topic** - Some topics might have better video knowledge in the AI
3. **I can further strengthen the prompt** or implement URL validation on the server

## 🎯 Summary

- ✅ AI prompt enhanced to require REAL URLs with examples
- ✅ Components now validate URLs before rendering
- ✅ Better logging to diagnose issues
- ✅ All changes are live (hot reload active)

**Next:** Generate a new course and see if videos work! 🚀
